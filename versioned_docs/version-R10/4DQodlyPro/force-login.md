With Qodly Studio for 4D, the ["force login" mode](https://developer.4d.com/docs/REST/authUsers#force-login-mode) allows you to control the number of opened web sessions that require 4D Client licenses. You can also [logout](#logout) the user at any moment to decrement the number of retained licenses.

## Configuration

Make sure the ["force login" mode](https://developer.4d.com/docs/REST/authUsers#force-login-mode) is enabled for your 4D application in the [Roles and Privileges page](https://developer.qodly.com/docs/studio/roles/rolesPrivilegesOverview), using the **Force login** option:

![alt-text](./img/forcelogin.png)

You can also set this option directly in the [**roles.json** file](https://developer.4d.com/docs/ORDA/privileges#rolesjson-file).

You just need then to implemented the [`authentify()`](https://developer.4d.com/docs/REST/authUsers#function-authentify) function in the datastore class and call it from the Qodly page. A licence will be consumed only when the user is actually logged.


:::note Compatibility

When the legacy login mode ([deprecated as of 4D 20 R6](https://blog.4d.com/force-login-becomes-default-for-all-rest-auth)) is enabled, any REST request, including the rendering of an authentication Qodly page, creates a web session on the server and gets a 4D Client license, whatever the actual result of the authentication. For more information, refer to [this blog post](https://blog.4d.com/improved-4d-client-licenses-usage-with-qodly-studio-for-4d) that tells the full story.

### Example

In a simple Qodly page with login/password inputs, a "Submit" button calls the following `authentify()` function we have implemented in the DataStore class:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="4D" label="4D" default>
    ```4d
	exposed Function authentify($credentials : Object) : Text
		var $salesPersons : cs.SalesPersonsSelection
		var $sp : cs.SalesPersonsEntity

		$salesPersons:=ds.SalesPersons.query("identifier = :1"; $credentials.identifier)
		$sp:=$salesPersons.first()

		If ($sp#Null)
			If (Verify password hash($credentials.password; $sp.password))
				Session.clearPrivileges()
				Session.setPrivileges("") //guest session

				return "Authentication successful"
			Else
				return "Wrong password"
			End if
		Else
			return "Wrong user"
		End if
	```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="qs" label="QodlyScript">
    ```qs
    exposed function authentify(credentials : Object) : string
		var salesPersons : cs.SalesPersonsSelection
		var sp : cs.SalesPersonsEntity

		salesPersons=ds.SalesPersons.query("identifier = :1", credentials.identifier)
		sp = salesPersons.first()

		if (sp!=Null)
			if (verifyPasswordHash(credentials.password, sp.password))
				session.clearPrivileges()
				session.setPrivileges("") //guest session

				return "Authentication successful"
			else
				return "Wrong password"
			end
		else
			return "Wrong user"
		end
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

This call is accepted and as long as the authentication is not successful, `Session.setPrivileges()` is not called, thus no license is consumed. Once `Session.setPrivileges()` is called, a 4D client licence is used and any REST request is then accepted.



## Logout

When the ["force login" mode is enabled](#force-login), Qodly Studio for 4D allows you to implement a logout feature in your application.

To logout the user, you just need to execute the **Logout** standard action from the Qodly page. In Qodly Studio, you can associate this standard action to a button for example:

![alt-text](./img/logout.png)

Triggering the logout action from a web user session has the following effects:

- the current web user session loses its privileges, only [descriptive REST requests](https://developer.4d.com/docs/REST/authUsers#descriptive-rest-requests) are allowed,
- the associated 4D license is released,
- the `Session.storage` is kept until the web session inactivity timeout is reached (at least one hour). During this period after a logout, if the user logs in again, the same session is used and the `Session.storage` shared object is available with its current contents.
